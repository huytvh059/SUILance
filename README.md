SuiLance
SuiLance is a decentralized freelance platform built on the Sui Blockchain. The project aims to address persistent issues in traditional Web2 freelance markets as well as current limitations of Web3 solutions, creating a fair, transparent, and secure working environment for both clients and freelancers.
The project is developed by Team WIT for the Sui Blockchain Competition.
Problems and Solutions
Challenges in the Current Market
Web2 platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, etc.): High intermediary fees (10–20%), centralized control leading to unreasonable account suspensions, and users not truly owning their reputation data.
Existing Web3 platforms: Frequent scams and payment defaults due to the lack of standardized escrow mechanisms and secure product delivery tools.
SuiLance Solution
SuiLance leverages smart contracts and an escrow mechanism to automate workflows, ensure transparency, and eliminate risks caused by third-party intermediaries.
Key Features
Escrow Smart Contract: Holds client payments securely and automatically releases funds once the job is completed.
On-chain Reputation NFT: Freelancer reputation and skill evaluations are stored directly on the blockchain in the form of NFTs.
Secure Data Delivery: Work deliverables are encrypted, stored on IPFS/Arweave, and only decrypted for the client after payment is completed.
Technology Stack
Sui Blockchain: A high-performance blockchain powering the system.
Move Language: A secure and efficient smart contract programming language.
Escrow Contract: Manages escrow and automated fund settlement.
IPFS / Arweave: Decentralized file storage solutions.
Web3 DApp UI: An intuitive and interactive user interface.
Workflow
The system consists of three main entities: Client, Freelancer and Escrow Smart Contract.
1.Client
